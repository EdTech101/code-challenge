# Frontend Engineer Coding Assignment 

## Assignment:

Using ReactJS, create a UI from scratch that pulls a list of users and displays them from
this random user generator endpoint ( https://randomuser.me/api/ ). Feel free to use any
boilerplate, although we would suggest using create-react-app for simplicity.

## Criteria:
1. Your list of users must match the design presented in Adobe XD. The document
presents a normal state of an individual user on the left and a hover state on the
right.
2. You should be building functional components whenever possible
3. Your feed should implement an infinite scrolling feature. Whenever you reach the
bottom of a list, it should append a new list of 20 users to the bottom.
4. Your feed must be able to filter by three choices from a select menu:
a. No Filter
b. Male
c. Female
5. When clicking a user card, it should permanently delete itself from the feed
6. [extra credit] The connect button should bring up a modal that displays the userâ€™s
contact information. 

## Run

```
npm install
yarn start
```
